Based at UCL's [Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/great-ormond-street-institute-child-health),
the ICH Computational Biology Club meets once a month to discuss recent
computational topics and papers, often presented by their authors.

It is co-organised by [Yara Sanchez Corrales](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/77936-yara-elena-sanchez-corrales) and [George Hall](https://ghall.co.uk), two postdoctoral research fellows in the lab of Prof Sergi Castellano. If you are interested in speaking, please [get in touch](mailto:y.sanchez-corrales@ucl.ac.uk;george.hall@ucl.ac.uk)! Our club hosts both internal and external speakers.

A list of our previous and upcoming sessions can be found [here](./talks).
