Based at UCL's [Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/great-ormond-street-institute-child-health),
the ICH Computational Biology Club meets once a month to discuss recent
computational topics and papers, often presented by their authors.

It is co-organised by [Yara Sanchez Corrales](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/77936-yara-elena-sanchez-corrales) and [George Hall](https://ghall.co.uk), two postdoctoral research fellows in the lab of [Prof Sergi Castellano](https://www.castellanolab.net/). If you are interested in speaking, please [get in touch](mailto:y.sanchez-corrales@ucl.ac.uk;george.hall@ucl.ac.uk)! Our club hosts both internal and external speakers.

A list of our previous and upcoming sessions can be found [here](./talks).

**Title:** Systems biology approaches to characterise host-microbe interactions during pregnancy

**Abstract:** Preterm birth remains the leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality globally and in the UK. Infection and perturbed host-microbe interactions are among the risk factors for spontaneous preterm birth. A healthy vaginal microbiome is characterised by ecological dominance of Lactobacillus spp. such as L. crispatus. Conversely, high diversity microbial communities often enriched with G. vaginalis and mixed anaerobes are associated not only with prematurity, but also with other adverse pregnancy and reproductive outcomes. However, these high diversity vaginal bacterial communities are also found frequently in healthy and asymptomatic pregnancies. To understand the individual differences in the host response these communities elicit, methods that capture the functional status of communities, not just their taxonomic composition, are required.
In this talk I will give an overview of my research using multi-omics, including microbiome profiling and mass spectrometry metabolomics, and computational data integration methods to characterise host-microbe interactions in reproductive mucosa and better understand how the functional status of microbial communities impacts pregnancy outcomes.


**Where:** In-person at the Zayed Centre for Research and online via Zoom

**When:** Thursday 25 September at 2pm
