Based at UCL's [Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/great-ormond-street-institute-child-health),
the ICH Computational Biology Club meets once a month to discuss recent
computational topics and papers, often presented by their authors.

It is co-organised by [Yara Sanchez Corrales](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/77936-yara-elena-sanchez-corrales) and [George Hall](https://ghall.co.uk), two postdoctoral research fellows in the lab of [Prof Sergi Castellano](https://www.castellanolab.net/). If you are interested in speaking, please [get in touch](mailto:y.sanchez-corrales@ucl.ac.uk;george.hall@ucl.ac.uk)! Our club hosts both internal and external speakers.

A list of our previous and upcoming sessions can be found [here](./talks).

**Title:** From Bin to Cell: Segmentation of Visium HD Spatial Transcriptomics Data

**Abstract:** Spatial transcriptomics techniques which allow profiling of full transcriptomes in tissue sections have advanced considerably in recent years. One such approach, Visium HD from 10X Genomics, boasts whole transcriptome analysis at a 2um resolution in fresh frozen and FFPE samples. The approach is however limited as it lacks native cell segmentation capability, thus 2um spots cannot be easily assigned to single cells and are rather binned (usually into 8um or 16um bins) in a grid fashion. This limitation results in many bins being a mixture of cells, which conflates downstream analysis. The python package bin2cell (Polanski et al 2024, BioRxiv) seeks to address this issue, leveraging the H&E image generated during the Visium HD pipeline to detect nuclei and assign overlapping 2um spots to predicted cells.

**Where:** In-person at the Zayed Centre for Research and online via Zoom

**When:** Thursday 8 May at 2pm
